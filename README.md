# TrafficLightSimulation

This is a simple TrafficLightSimulation program made as a minor project during 3rd sem of my CSIT. There's a traffic light and a moving car. Car behaves according to that of 
traffic light. Car tends to stop when there is yellow light, stops for red light for 5 seconds and when green light glows, it again runs.
